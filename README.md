##scRNAseq Analysis Script

#Overview
This script is used to analyse single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. It applies the Seurat workflow to preprocess, normalise, and cluster the data, and uses custom-defined gene panels to explore biological processes such as sex differentiation, reproductive system development, cholesterol biosynthesis, and muscle development. The script generates visualisations, including dot plots, to highlight gene expression patterns across clusters.
